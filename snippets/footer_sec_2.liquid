    <h3>2 door wardrobe with mirror</h3>
    <p>Cupboards may feature mirrors or be without mirrors. 2 door mirrored wardrobes can double up as dressers as well. Moreover, the mirror on the wardrobe can make the room look bigger due to reflection. Wardrobes with mirrors usually have the mirror on one of the doors. This means you’d not have to have a separate dresser.
    </p>
    <h3>2 door wardrobe without mirror</h3>
    <p>Wardrobes are available without mirrors as well. If you already have a dressing table in the room and do not want to add another mirror in the room, it’s best to opt for a wardrobe without a mirror. Wardrobes without mirrors have a different kind of aesthetic look compared to mirrored wardrobes.

It is the strength and durability of the material that would ensure the longevity of the cupboard. If you’re looking for a strong 2 door wardrobe, you should explore MDF, engineered wood, etc.
    </p>

On At-Home, you can find 2 door wardrobes starting from INR 10,000. The price of the wardrobe depends on factors such as its size, design, material, features, etc. For example, a mirrored 2 door wardrobe would be a little more expensive than one without a mirror. One of the best things about buying furniture online is that you can compare prices of different pieces and then buy the best one that suits your budget.</p>
    <h3>Buy two door wardrobe based on storage requirements</h3>
    <p>We use wardrobes for storage. So it’s most important that you choose a 2 door wardrobe with drawers that provides enough storage space for all your belongings. Not just that, your wardrobe should also have separate storage options for different items such as clothes, jewelry, accessories, valuable things such as diamonds, cash, and more. If you require more storage space you could even buy two 2 door wardrobes.</p>
    <h2>Factors to consider when you buy a two door wardrobe</h2>
    <h3>Space in your room</h3>
    <p>A 2 door wardrobe is no doubt smaller than a 3 door wardrobe, but it’s still big and requires a considerable amount of space in the room. Hence, one of the first things you should do is measure the space for the cupboard in the room. You should also measure the size of the cupboard to assess if it would fit in the space you have allotted it in the room.</p>
    <h3>Door type of the wardrobe</h3>
    <p>Wardrobes have different types of doors. Some wardrobes have sliding doors. Two door wardrobes too can have sliding doors. The benefit of sliding doors is that it does not require space for doors to open outside. Here, the doors slide from left to right or the other way and hence require lesser space.</p>
    <h3>Interior compartments in the wardrobe</h3>
    <p>Wardrobes are designed for storage and to help us keep things organized. The compartments in the inside of the wardrobes enable us to store different things. When you buy a 2 door wardrobe with drawers and compartments, make sure they’re enough. Another factor to consider is the size of the drawers and compartments.</p>
    <h3>Design and color of the wardrobe</h3>
    <p>The
      <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/2-door">
        <u>2 door wardrobe</u>
      </a>
      you choose should go with the look and feel of the room in which you’re going to keep it. Hence, you’ll have to consider the design and color of the wardrobe. Choose a color that matches the color scheme of the other furniture and linen of the room. The design too should complement the other furniture.</p>
    <h2>How to take care of your wardrobe</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Clean the wardrobe from the inside regularly</b>
    </p>
    <p>Clean your 2 door wardrobe from the inside. It’s important to clean it thoroughly with a mild wood cleansing solution or any wardrobe cleaning solution so that it’s free from dust, fungus or any mold that was settled in from before. Make sure you clean all the hangar rods, drawers, shelves, and sides. Clean everything with a damp cloth and let it dry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Don’t overstuff your 2 door wardrobe</b>
    </p>
    <p>You might have too many things but that doesn’t mean you should stuff all your things inside one wardrobe? You could buy two 2 door wardrobes. Overstuffing can damage your clothes. Clothes need some air and breathing space and if you stuff them all together, it can start gathering dampness and smelliness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Add some fragrance inside your wardrobe</b>
    </p>
    <p>Clothes that smell good can have an instant effect on the way you feel. Make sure you bring in some fragrance inside your closet. It will help to keep the smell of dampness away. Besides, your clothes will smell fresh every time you take them out. Fragrance is one of the wardrobe essentials that we tend to ignore, but is important.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Keep humidity out of your 2 door wardrobe</b>
    </p>
    <p>Clean your two door wardrobe regularly. Make sure it’s dry before you put clothes inside it. Keep both the wardrobe doors open for sometime and let it air a bit. Give some air to your clothes by removing them from the cupboard every once in a while. Do not put wet or damp clothes inside the wardrobe. You could even use silica gel or other natural ways to keep the wardrobes free of humidity.</p>

    </p>
    <h2>What furniture should you buy for your dining room?</h2>
    <p>While you might want to buy a lot of furniture for your dining space, let’s face the fact, most dining spaces have a limited space. And hence, you’d have to choose what furniture to buy for your dining area.
    </p>
    <p>Some furniture pieces are a must in the dining space. For example, a dining area without a dining table and dining chairs is incomplete. And hence, you must select a dining table set first. Or, you could select a dining table and chairs separately and create your own unique set.
    </p>
    <p>You should determine how many dining chairs you’d need for your dining table. You could even pair your dining chairs with one bench. Dining benches make a trendy statement in modern homes. They also help to accommodate more people when there are guests at home.
    </p>
    <p>Besides the usual, you can explore other different types of furniture such as a crockery rack, a serving trolley, a high chair for babies, etc. if you have the space to keep them.
    </p>
    <p>Apart from furniture, you must also look at decor and functional accessories for your dining room such as a
      <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/rugs">
        <u>rug</u>
      </a>, a wall clock, pots,
      <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/potted-plant-trees">
        <u>planters</u>
      </a>, and plants, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Factors to consider when buying dining furniture</h2>
    <h3>Space</h3>
    <p>First, you must know how much space you have available in your dining room and then decide what size of a dining table you should look for. The size depends on many factors. How many people do you need to accommodate in the dining space on a daily basis. If you have  a big family, you should go for a 6 seater dining table, or even an 8 seater. If your requirement is for a lesser number of people, go for a 4 seater dining table set. Is your dining area small and can accommodate only a 4 seater? If that’s the case, you should narrow down your search accordingly only for a 4 seater dining set.
    </p>
    <h3>Comfort</h3>
    <p>A quick online search for dining tables will bring up options of dining tables and chairs made in different kinds of materials - sheesham, teak, MDF, engineered wood - to plastic, metal, and marble, among others.</p>
    <p>You should choose the material based on a couple of factors. First, the comfort levels. Try to choose a material that would make your experience comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>That said, you can even mix and match furniture made from different materials, such as a wrought iron table can easily be paired with wooden chairs if the design complements.</p>
    <h3>Look and feel</h3>
    <p>The next key factor is the design or style of the dining furniture. From minimalist designs to contemporary pop to modern dining table, you can get spoiled for choice when looking to buy a dining table, dining chairs, etc. Here are some tips to help you select the perfect design and style for your dining space:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The design of your home dining furniture should depend on the decor style of your home. For example, if you have a minimalist style preference, go for a
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/dining-furniture/products/leaf-6-seater-dining-table-walnut-fidtleafdt6strwlt">
          <u>simple dining table</u>
        </a>. Having a decorative dining table might not go well with your style preference</li>
      <li>Next, always look for functionality over design. Even though the design may be good, always look for the other factors such as durability, the finish, and whether or not it goes well with your home decor aesthetic.
      </li>
      <li>Go with your personal style. Your dining space should carry your personality and hence, no matter the trend, choose a design that you know you will like for the next few years at least. If your taste tilts toward modern, go for a modern dining table design characterized by curvy corners, elegance and solid lines.
      </li>
      <li>Do not hesitate to mix and match and put together your unique dining table set. For example, you can buy the dining table and chairs separately. You can bring in different types of chairs and a
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/dining-furniture/products/leaf-6-seater-dining-bench-walnut-fidbleafdb6strwlt">
          <u>dining bench</u>
        </a>. You do not have to follow any rules.</li>
