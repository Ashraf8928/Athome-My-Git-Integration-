      from a wide range of choices.
    </p>
    <h2>Buy planters, pots, and planted pots from At-Home</h2>
    <h3>Buy planted pots of different shapes and sizes</h3>
    <p>Indoor plant pots are available of different sizes as well as shapes. While the choice of shape is all about your personal taste, the size you choose would depend on a few factors.</p>
    <p>First, the space available in your room. The first thing you’ll have to ascertain is the space in your room. If the space is small, you’ll have to select the size accordingly. If you have large space, you can fit in large size decor plants.
    </p>
    <p>Another key factor is the height of the pot and how you are going to place it. For example, if you’re going to place it on a pedestal, consider the final height of the pot and the plant. It shouldn’t be too high because that won’t clearly ruin the aesthetics.</p>
    <p>Pots and planters are available in different shapes, as well. Round, cylindrical, square, short, tall, among other shapes. You can choose the shape based on your choice.</p>
    <h3>Explore planted pots of different colors</h3>

    <p>Indoor plant pots are available of different materials. At-Home has a wide range of materials for artificial plants. Artificial plants can be made of different materials such as fabric, foam, plastic, among other materials.
    </p>
    <p>When you choose the material, keep in mind a few factors. For example, how easy or difficult would it be for you to clean the plants? Plants could gather a lot of dust, fungus, etc. You should choose a material that is easy to clean.</p>

    <p>Decorative flower pots are made of materials such as ceramic or glass. You should choose the material based on some factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plastic pots</b>
    </p>
    <p>Plastic pots are lightweight. They are also, most often, more affordable. Plastic pots are available in different colors. Many people choose to buy plastic pots for indoor use because they aren’t exposed to sunlight and hence can stay new for longer.</p>
    <p>

    <p>Ceramic flower pots are made of clay. These pots look much better aesthetically compared to plastic pots. Ceramic flower pots are also good for growing plants. You can also have succulent plants in ceramic pots. These pots are glazed in different colors. However, ceramic pots have a tendency to break and crack. Hence, one has to be extremely careful with these pots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Hanging pots</b>
    </p>
    <p>Another interesting type of pots are hanging pots. These can be used for decor plants in the house. You can even have hanging planters on the balcony.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Keep it safe</b>
    </p>
    <p>Wherever you keep your planters in the house, make sure it’s kept safely. For example, hanging pots can get heavy. Hence, make sure you hang them by a strong hook or beam. Another thing to keep in mind is the place where you hang it. It’s safer to hang it in places under which people don’t sit or walk too much. So that even if there’s any accident, no one would get hurt. Another aspect is the type of home plants you choose. For example, it’s best to avoid cactus in the house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>To fill in large spaces</b>
    </p>
    <p>At times, you might have empty spots in your rooms. One of the best ways to fill them is with planters. Not only will it fill the space, it will also enhance the look and feel of the room.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>To deck up mundane places</b>
    </p>
    <p>Let’s face it – not all spaces in the house have the potential for a decorative artifact, a painting, or even furniture. So, what do you do in such spaces? For example, the space available under a staircase or space in the washroom. You can easily enhance these spaces with the help of indoor plants. You could bring large

    <h1>PAINTING</h1>
    <p>Painting is an artwork, it is a form of expression where the artist puts his thoughts in colours. When you use a wall painting for your
      <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/wall-arts">
        <u>wall art</u>
      </a>
      design, you are essentially expressing yourself. A painting is not just a decor element, rather, it is a medium of expression and showcases your personality. Wall paintings add a personal touch and aesthetic addition to your home decor. Wall art paintings bring back the human touch to our rooms and decor.</p>
    <h3>Why should we select wall painting for home decor?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wall art adds to the colour of the room. A painting is multi-hued and it adds to the vibrancy of your interiors. Colour selection is by far the most difficult part of the decor. Selecting the colour of the walls, and the furniture and then matching it all without making it overbright is difficult.  Paintings if chosen beforehand help you select the colour of your walls or they can add the much-needed colour pop to your existing walls.</li>
      <li>Paintings add finishing touches to a wall.
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/wall-arts">
          <u>Wall art</u>
        </a>
        is the decor item that ties up all the elements in a room. It transforms the room and doesn’t leave any blank spaces that look unfinished.</li>
      <li>Paintings add texture to the walls. A wall is flat when there is no wall art. It is unidimensional. A wall art painting adds to the texture of the wall. It makes the wall appear 3D.</li>
      <li>Wall art paintings grab attention in room decor. Whenever you enter a room, a painting will be the first to grab your attention. Therefore, it acts as the focal point of a decor. Hanging framed wall art over the headboard, in front of the couch, over the mantelpiece or any area where the wall is blank will grab attention.</li>
      <li>It allows you to display your personality, thoughts and ideas. It adds warmth and homeliness to a room. It makes an impersonal room feel personal and welcoming.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to choose a wall painting?</h3>
    <p>One thumb rule for interior design is that there are no wrongs when it comes to selecting wall art. It is important to choose something you love that looks good on the wall while making you happy.</p>
    <p>After that the things you should consider are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The size of the
        <b>wall art-</b>
        It is important to note the size of the
        <b>wall painting</b>
        that one needs to hang on the wall. Along with the size of the painting, one needs to know the size of the wall where the painting is to be hung. A small painting like this can’t be placed on a large wall and vice versa. It should balance with the size of the other objects such as a
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/tv-units">
          <u>TV unit</u>
        </a>, sofa, etc.
        <br><br>
        The size of the
        <b>wall painting</b>
        also depends upon the number of pieces you want to hang and the placement of it. If you are hanging a single
        <b>wall art painting</b>
        like
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/paintings/products/radha-krishna-painting-sea-green-hpg12icstsgr00127">
          <u>this</u>
        </a>, then you can choose a large or oversized piece, if you are looking to hang multiple paintings as well as a
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/wall-clocks">
          <u>wall clock</u>
        </a>, then you have to consider the size of each with the total gap available after each one of them is placed.
        <br><br>
        <p>The common size of framed wall paintings is understood as:-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Oversized refers to that size of the painting which is 1 metre or larger in length. These are generally used in mantle places, above the headboard, and over the couch among others. These pieces are used to create a focal point in the room.</li>
          <li>Large refers to the size of the painting which is between 80 and 100 centimetres in length. These are great as wall art decor like centrepieces or even as mantle pieces and headboard pieces in small rooms.
          </li>
          <li>Medium-sized framed wall painting refers to approximately 60 to 80 centimetres in length. This is the most used size and a versatile size. This can be used alone, in a combination with two paintings or a gallery
            <b>wall art design</b>.</li>
          <li>Small this refers to a size between 45 to 60 centimetres. They are wall art paintings that are seldom used alone. They are used along with other sizes and are grouped.</li>
          <li>Mini wall paintings seldom exist. Sized between 25 and 45 centimetres in length, these paintings are most commonly used on shelves, in kitchens or in massive gallery arrangements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Wall decor paintings should always be selected by the style of the room. The style or theme of the room should be important when choosing paint. A
        <b>wall painting</b>
        has many facets that can fit into multiple styles. It still is important to understand the style of the room so that the paintings don’t clash with the decor.  A modern decor can still have subtle colour beach paintings or abstract art. For example, it should match furniture like
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/lounge-accent">
          <u>lounge chairs</u>
        </a>, sofa, etc.</li>
      <li>Colours- if you have decided on a piece of art, then match the colours of the room with your paintings. An extreme contrast will always clash and not look good. For example, if you have a yellow
        <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/book-shelfs">
          <u>book shelf</u>
        </a>, you should go for something complementing yellow.</li>
      <li>If you are not sure and can’t understand how to match
        <b>wall paintings</b>
        to the interiors of your room, then it is always safer to go for timeless arts,

        </a>
        and folk paintings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Wall Arts</h1>
    <p>For a long time, blank walls were normal.
      <b>Wall art</b>

        up and makes it look finished rather than blank and missing. When the right design fit matches the decor it brightens up the place and makes it look glammed up.</li>

        <b>Wall art</b>
        will always add to the textural balance of a room. It will bring in the much-needed texture addition to the decor. A flat wall always needs depth and dimension to grab attention and look good. Which essentially is always missing in a wallpaper. Therefore,
        <b>wall art</b>
        is needed. When you look for
        <b>wall art design</b>

    </ul>
    <h3>How to Choose Wall Art?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Where do you intend to place it? The location of the wall art is extremely important. Which room are you selecting to place your wall art? Is it the living room, the bedroom, the kitchen, or a hallway? The location makes an important factor in choosing the
        <b>wall decor</b>. The size of the space and the lighting determine the kind of
        <b>wall art decor</b>
        you’d choose.
      </li>
      <li>The colours of the wall play the next most important factor. One cannot have a
        <b>wall art design</b>
        in extremely contrasting colours. Also, the colour scheme is highly influenced by the colour scheme. So a subtle and light coloured wall can be made dramatic and pop out with a very bright painting, whereas a bold and dramatic wall can be accentuated with
        <b>mirror wall art</b>.</li>
      <li>Play with the theme of your room. One should mix and match the
        <b>wall decor</b>
        with that of the room. A wall art design needn’t be the same style as the room, but it shouldn’t be a complete contrast. A modern room would look better with modern wall art, but also looks good with

    <h3>Usage of clocks as per Vaastu</h3>
    <p>Vaastu is a guidelines according to Indian traditional studies of architecture, placement and construction. It talks about how what should reside where. They believe in aligning things as per geometric alignment of the construction of a house.</p>
    <p>Vaastu shastra, or Vaastu science, lays a lot of emphasis on the direction of a clock. As per this science, the direction where a clock, a

        <u>wall clock</u>
      </a>
      or a table clock is placed, defines the flow of energy, peace, prosperity of the house.
    </p>
    <p>The clocks placement tips as to Vaastu-</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A clock should always be placed in the North or East. It can be placed in the west if there is no place in North or East. The north and eastern directions are considered the directions for wealth and prosperity. They have strong flows there and therefore, should be placed there.
      </li>
      <li>A clock is explicitly prohibited to be placed in South. It is believed that it is the direction of death and destruction and thus should be avoided.</li>
      <li>A clock should never exceed the height of your doorway. If you are placing vintage table clocks over shelves, make sure the shelf is under the height of your doorway.</li>
      <li>According to vastu rules, clocks should be placed in the east in bedrooms. If east is not possible, then the northern direction. It should never be placed overhead.
      </li>
      <li>In the bedrooms, Vaastu suggests clocks should be as far from your bedside, so a table clock next to your bed is not a great idea. But since we all need alarm

      <b>How to measure the wall when the door opens on that wall?</b>
    </p>
    <p>Ideally for wall art it is a rule to keep the door open and then measure the wall. The wall till where the knob reaches should be marked. Then the wall from that mark till the other end should be measured for using wall decor design. This makes sure your wall art fits perfectly and looks good. It doesn’t look offcentre.</p>
