It is the aspect that will decide how your room looks after placing the wardrobe in it and the overall personality of your room.

  <h4>Explore Quality Mattress Protectors From At-Home</h4>
  <p>One of the most basic requirements of good sleep is hygiene in the bedroom. More specifically, the bed, mattress and the pillows we use should always be clean. To keep the mattress clean and safe, we need to use a mattress protector. A good quality <u><a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/mattress-protectors/instock">mattress protector</a></u> is a must. </p>
  <h5>Buy mattress protectors by At-Home</h5>
  <p><b>What is a mattress protector?</b></p>
  <p>A mattress protector is a cover for the mattress. It is made of fabric. Mattress protectors help cover the whole mattress or at least the top and sides of the mattress so that the mattress does not get dirty. It protects dust, particles, and moisture from settling on the mattress. Waterproof mattress protectors keep water from seeping inside the mattress if there is spill on the mattress. The mattress protector either has buttons, zip, elastic or fabric tie-ups to secure it on the mattress. Some mattress protectors also have velcro to fasten the cover. </p>
  <h5>Reasons to buy a mattress protector</h5>
  <p><b>For the longevity of the mattress</b></p>
  <p>Mattresses are big and expensive. They need to be taken care of so that they can be used for years. Most people use mattresses for decades. It’s possible that some mattresses may not be of good quality. But that problem can be tackled by covering it with a good mattress protector.</p>
  <p><b>Makes mattress feel softer</b></p>
  <p>Mattress protectors that are made of soft material can make mattresses feel softer. They add one more layer between the mattress and the bedsheet and hence, enhance the softness. </p>
  <p><b>Save extra expenses</b></p>
  <p>A mattress protector protects mattresses from getting dirty. It helps save the mattress from dust, particles, and spills. This means the mattress can be used for years or decades, and as a result, you won’t have to spend on mattresses often.</p>
  <p><b>Clean mattress less often</b></p>
  <p>When you keep something clean, you have to wash it less. Of course, you can’t really wash mattresses, but it makes it a lot easier to maintain the mattress if you cover it with a mattress protector. </p>
  <h5>Choose the best quality mattress protector</h5>
  <p><b>Material</b></p>
  <p>Mattress protectors are made of different materials such as cotton, polyester, and poly cotton among others. When choosing the material of the mattress protector you must check a couple of factors:</p>
  <p>The softness of the material. If you prefer a soft material, polyester or poly cotton would be better than cotton. If you are okay with the material being a little rough, choose cotton.</p>
  <p>Another factor to look at properly is the thread count, the tightness of the material, the tightness of the stitch and the quality of stitching. You don’t want your mattress protector to sag or crease too much. It can lead to discomfort.</p>
  <p><b>Size</b></p>
  <p>It’s pointless to buy an ill-fitting mattress protector. Too big and it will form creases and affect the way the bed sheet fits on the mattress. Too small and it won’t fit the mattress so it would not be of any use. </p>
  <p>Choose the size of the <u><a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/mattress-protectors/instock">mattress protector</a></u> based on the size of the mattress. Different brands follow different standard sizes. Mattress protectors are also available in these different sizes. </p>
  <p><b>Color</b></p>
  <p>White, beige, maroon, brown, mattress protectors are available in different shades. You can buy a light color or a dark color based on your choice. </p>

  <p>Sometimes pillows may not need a full wash. If there’s a stain or a spot in one area of the pillow, you might not need to wash it fully. You can spot clean the pillow. Just wash the pillow in that area where it’s dirty. Use water and a mild soap, rub it on the pillow to remove the stain. Put it out to dry in the sun.</p>

What is more, elements such as <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/serving-cart"><u>serving carts</u></a> also help make the dining experience more comfortable. </p>
  <h2>2. Preventing digestion problems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Devices like mobile phones and television cause slow and distracted eating. This results in causing digestion problems which is a common problem nowadays. A dining table increases your concentration on eating. </li>
    <li>People often begin to eat while standing or lying down because of a lack of time. Your posture while eating affects your ability to digest. It causes many digestive problems like gastric reflux, heartburn, and bloating.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A dining table and dining chairs assure a better posture and mindful eating. </p>
  <h2>3. Escape from stressful life</h2>
  <p>One can use mealtime on a dining table to de-stress from the daily grind. It gives you a moment to relax and cherish your loved ones.</p>
  <h2>4. Enhance home aesthetics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A dining room influences overall home decor. A well-decorated dining area provides an elegant space. This not only pleases the occupants of the house but also entertains the guests. A dining table is the protagonist of the dining area. So, it is very important to choose the right kind of dining table.</li>
    <li>A <b>6-seater dining set</b> is available with diverse options in colour, finish, material, and additional functionality. The <b>6-seater dining table</b> is an excellent choice for a family with kids or grandparents.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to select the right dining set for you?</h2>
    <h4>1. Space </h4>
    <p>Assess the space of your room. The <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/dining-sets"><u>dining set</u></a> should allow diners to have their meals comfortably. Try to leave a 100-120 cm distance between your table and the walls. </p>
    <p>The 6-seater dining table should complement the space. This prevents the room from looking too spacious or crowded. If space is an issue, one can opt for the extendable feature of a 6-seater dining set. Unfold it when it is not in use and extend it when required. Another option is to get a <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/dining-bench"><u>dining bench</u></a>.</p>
    <h4>2. The shape of the table </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rooms with space issues can go for round tables. Since a round table has no corner, one can fit as many people in a limited space. It also has no sharp edges hence better for small children.</li>
      <li><b>6-seater dining set</b> with a round top is also a perfect fit for a square room.</li>
      <li>If the room is long and narrow, a long rectangular 6- seater dining table is suitable. As it mimics the shape of a room providing more space.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Material of the dining set</h4>
    <p>A dining set of good quality and durability is essential for its maintenance in the long run. So, the right material should be selected carefully according to your needs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wooden</li>
      <p>If you choose a wooden dining table, opt for hardwoods such as walnut, mahogany, oak, or teak. Wood is strong and durable. It provides versatility along with sustainability. It is a better option than glass if you have small kids. I love the collection at-home. They have such a versatile collection.</p>
      <li>Glass</li>
      <p>A glass top works well with several decors. Since glass tables are reflective, they add an elegant and brighter feel to the room. The see-through feature makes the dining hall appear more open and airy. They are easy to clean and maintain. The only drawback is that finger stains are often more visible on the glass. I love the glass top collection at at-home. It is second to none.</p>
      <li>MDF</li>
      <p>Another material used for dining sets is medium density fiberboard (MDF). It is known for its durability and quality. It is extremely easy to clean. A laminated MDF does not even warp or crack like wood. Some of the best models are available here <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/"><u>at-home</u></a>.</p>
      <li>Natural stones</li>
      <p>Natural stones require maintenance but their artistic look is worth it. A quartz table top is highly durable and resistant to scratches, unlike glass. Granite can also be good material for a dining table as it is strong and heat resistant.</p>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Functionality</h4>
    <p>A dining table is the centre of attraction of the room, it should be adaptable according to your needs and style. Features like an adjustable height or a pull-out end that can double as a desk are beneficial for children. A dining table with drawers provides you with additional space. You can store items needed for a <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/dining-table"><u>dining table</u></a> such as napkins and cutlery sets.</p>
    <h4>5. Home decor</h4>
    <p>You can choose a dining set that goes well with the walls and furniture if any. </p>
    <p>You can match the table and chair but it is not necessary. You can try a <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/dining-table-6-seater/products/avante-6-seater-dining-table-with-fixed-top-brown-fidtavantedt6sfcap"><u>6-seater dining set</u></a> with different dining chairs and tables and a dining bench.</p>
    <p>A coordinated style of decor can create a room with good flow and unity. You can choose to mix between tables, chairs, wood, and other furniture, such as buffets. You can always experiment with your dining set according to your interiors. </p>
    <h2>FAQ’s</h2>
    <p><b>How to choose the right shape for the dining set?</b></p>

  <p><b>The size of your bedroom</b></p>

  <p><b>Consider the mattress</b></p>
  <p>Most people buy a bed before buying the <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/doctor-dreams-mattress"><u>mattress</u></a>. However, it’s possible that you already have a good king size mattress and you only need a king size bed. Choose the size of the bed carefully. Different brands may have different king bed sizes.</p>

A <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/bed-king-size/products/borden-king-bed-hydraulic-storage-black-fikbbordenkbbdblk"><u>low king size bed</u></a> might be more comfortable.

  <h2>How to enhance a king size bed?</h2>
  <p>Even though you might have a modern king size bed, it’s important to make it look good. To do so you can do a few things.</p>
  <p>Get a mattress cover for your king bed mattress. Next, you could add a bed cover. The bed cover will keep your bed sheet clean as well as enhance the look. Finally, you can spread a blanket on it. Another thing you can do is get some <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/rugs"><u>carpets</u></a> for the floor.</p>
  <p>Now, you can add an assortment of pillows and cushions. Cushions and pillows are the best accessories to style your king size bed. And there are many ways in which you can arrange cushions. </p>
  <p>If you have a wooden king size bed, you’d want to add a dash of color to the neutral browns. While monochrome pillows look good, if you want to take the styling a notch higher, add one or two colorful pillows. </p>
  <p>When you buy a king size bed, don’t forget about the other bedroom furniture that your room would need – a dressing table, <a href="https://www.at-home.co.in/collections/book-shelfs"><u>book shelves</u></a>, a chair, a wardrobe, etc. </p>
